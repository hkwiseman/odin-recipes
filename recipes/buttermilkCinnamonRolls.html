    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
      <li>.25 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1.5 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>.5 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>.5 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>.5 cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1.25 cups brown sugar</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy,
        about 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, heat the buttermilk until warm to
        the touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the buttermilk and oil into the yeast mixture; mix well. Combine
        the flour, salt and baking soda. Stir the flour mixture into the liquid
        1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly
        floured surface and knead 20 times. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
        In a small bowl, stir together the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out into a large rectangle.
        Spread the brown sugar and butter mixture over the dough, roll up into a
        log and pinch the seam to seal. Slice into 1 inch pieces and place cut
        side up in a lightly greased 10x15 baking pan. Cover and let rise 30
        minutes or cover and refrigerate overnight. If baking immediately,
        preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Let
        stand for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
